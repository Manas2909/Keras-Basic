# Keras-Basic
Basic implementation of keras and VGG like NN
Dataset not included due to size constraints

Please have a basic about argument parsing in python.


Keras Learning rate decay scheduler.
It illustrates how reducing the learning rate over time improves our model.
Here it was tested on cifar-10 dataset using resnet architecture.
